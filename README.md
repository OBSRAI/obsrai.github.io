# Overview

OBSRAI introduces a novel benchmark tailored specifically for urban-specific challenges using geospatial vector data. This benchmark is crafted to facilitate the development and evaluation of geospatial models, aiding efforts in urban planning, mobility prediction, and environmental monitoring.

# Key Features
- **Open Data:** All datasets included in the benchmark are openly licensed, ensuring accessibility and transparency for research and commercial use.
- **Diverse Tasks:** The benchmark covers five distinct geospatial tasks to challenge and evaluate the versatility of spatial representation models.
- **Global Scope:** Datasets span multiple cities across three continents, providing a diverse testing ground for geospatial analytics.

# Benchmark Structure

The benchmark is organized into subpages for each specific downstream task, as described below:

## [Human Mobility Prediction](human-mobility-prediction/description.md)
- **Purpose:** To predict human movement patterns within urban environments using data from various mobility datasets.

## [Short-Term Rental Price Prediction](short-term-rental-price-prediction/description.md)
- **Purpose:** To forecast rental prices based on the features extracted from Airbnb dataset listings.

## [Housing Prices Prediction](housing-prices-prediction/description.md)
- **Purpose:** To model housing market dynamics and predict property values using real estate data.

## [Crime Activity Prediction](crime-activity-prediction/description.md)
- **Purpose:** To anticipate crime occurrences and patterns using historical crime data.

## [Time Travel Estimation](time-travel-estimation/description.md)
- **Purpose:** To estimate travel times based on taxi trajectory data, aiding in traffic management and urban planning.

# Accessing the Data
