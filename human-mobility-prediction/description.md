# Human Mobility Prediction

## Overview
This task focuses on predicting human movement patterns within urban environments. It leverages mobility data from diverse sources to model and forecast how people traverse through cities.

## Dataset
The datasets used for this task include:
- Geolife
- Porto Taxi Data
- T-Drive

## Objective
To develop models that can accurately predict the trajectories of individuals based on historical mobility data.

## Challenges
- Handling high-dimensional spatial data
- Ensuring the privacy of individual trajectories
- Adapting models to different urban environments

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
